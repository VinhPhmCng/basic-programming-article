== Contribute ü§ù

=== Install PreTeXt

Using https://pypi.org/[pip]:

[source]
----
pip install pretext
----

=== Install a TeX distribution

I prefer https://miktex.org/download[MiKTeX] over https://www.tug.org/texlive/[TeX Live] and other options.

If you use MiKTeX, when you first build a PreTeXt project, it will ask for permission to install the requisite packages.

=== Use VSCode and PreTeXt-tools (Optional)

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oscarlevin.pretext-tools[PreTeXt-tools] is an official extension for VSCode, which offers language support and more for PreTeXt projects.

=== Clone the repo

Navigate to a suitable directory and clone the repository:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/VinhPhmCng/basic-programming-article.git
