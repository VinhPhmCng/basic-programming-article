    <p>
      Coming up are some of the many lessons I've learned throughout my journey as a programmer. Before we start, I'd like to have some words with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if I could restart my journey as a programmer, I'd still do things all the same. It is thanks to the lessons I've learned from being inexperienced that I am who I am today. Others I learned by reading about people's mistakes on the Internet and avoiding making them, which is why I thought this section's a good idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your first exposure to programming is this article, then it's likely that your starting mindset will be very different from mine, in a good way of course.
    </p>

    <p>
      Truthfully though, I'd like you to make a lot of mistakes still, which is why I won't write step-by-step guides on how to avoid them, but instead my personal opinions. This is actually how my parents raised me, for which I'm extremely grateful. Basically, they didn't keep me away from making mistakes, which would mean I wasn't learning anything. Instead, they taught me about self-reflection and how to get the most learning out of mistakes. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay then, I hope this section will be useful for you!
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-pe-start-simple">
    <title>Start Simple</title>

    <warning>
      <p>
        You can choose a programming language and a code editor/IDE by thinking simply.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Start by coming up with a small and achievable idea. Then, look for suitable tools and learning resources by asking the Internet.
      </p>
    </warning>
    
    <p>
      I think when I first got into programming, I cared too much about choosing a programming language to learn. My Youtube feed always had those topics mentioned in <xref ref="insight-choose-pro-language" text="global"/>. My inexperienced self would think those were important things to consider, and I'd watch every video that showed up to see people's opinions. But doing all that only made me scared of actually learning to code because I'd start asking myself questions like: 

      <ul>
        <li>
          <q>What if I learn the <sq>wrong</sq> language and it gets obsolete in the future?</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          <q>What if A becomes a better choice than B a few years from now?</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          <q>How long would it take me to <sq>master</sq> this language?</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          <etc />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point, I learned to think in a different way. For instance, there's a time when I was very into game development, and it kinda went like this:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <q>Okay. I wanna make a game, so let's look up <sq>game engines for beginners</sq> on Google.</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          After a few articles and videos, I ended up with Godot<mdash />an open-source game engine that's been gaining popularity, has a big and supportive community, and sufficient documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <q>Okay, now do I wanna use GDScript (Godot's built-in language which has beginner-friendly syntax), or C# (a popular language which is lower-level)?</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          Well, that question took me just 10 seconds to answer. <q>I ain't about to learn C# to make no games.</q>
        </li>
      </ul>

      After that, it was really just a constant cycle of studying online materials and experimenting with stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because I already had some ideas in mind, I got straight into making them and learning necessary concepts along the way, but never more than I needed. If I got stuck, it'd mean I had some online research to do. Otherwise, I was doing just fine with whatever knowledge I had, even if my solutions weren't the most effective or beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personally, I think it's good that I did that instead of watching a 12-hour course covering every little thing about game development and then making somebody else's idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      <sq>Starting simple</sq> can also be applied to choosing a code editor or IDE (integrated development environment). Until now, I think I've tried 5 IDE at most, and I've stuck with VSCode for a while because, again, it's user-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code cells provided in this article are very minimal and might be slightly inconvenient, but they're everything you need to start, aren't they?
    </p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-pe-tutorial-hell">
    <title>The Tutorial Hell</title>

    <warning>
      <p>
        Just do something. You learn by doing, not by mindlessly consuming content.
      </p>
    </warning>
    
    <p>
      The tutorial hell is something every programmer has experienced. It's when you are constantly watching videos and reading articles teaching you to do something, but you never actually sit down and type away at a computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason for this phenomenon could be a lack of motivation or ideas, procrastination, poor social media management, <etc /> It's also because there's an abundance of online contents about coding, which can be excessive sometimes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever this happens to me, I'd force myself to put down the phone and turn on my computer. Then I'd open up Google and VSCode and start looking for something very easy to do and also interesting enough. This whole process takes at most 5 minutes, but it always gets me to begin writing some code, whatever it may be about.
    </p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-pe-have-fun">
    <title>Have Fun</title>

    <warning>
      <p>
        So long as you find joy in the process, you can always get back to it and do better than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you keep learning and doing, you will improve without a doubt.
      </p>
    </warning>
    
    <p>
      Since stress and burn-outs are gonna be unavoidable sometimes, I think it's incredibly important to always have fun with the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't worry, you're definitely gonna experience stuff like:
      <ul>
        <li>
          error messages showing up one after another
        </li>
        <li>
          getting stuck when following step-by-step installation guides
        </li>
        <li>
          understanding nothing about a new concept
        </li>
        <li>
          <etc />
        </li>
      </ul>
      And sometimes you're gonna feel as though you're not making any progress, so you doubt yourself and wonder if programming is not the way to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, these kinds of stress occur in every creative discipline and to everybody. Some days are good, some days are bad. So, why not just enjoy the process and have fun along the way?
    </p>

    <p>
      Know that even if you think you're not making any progress, you definitely are. The author of <sq>Atomic Habits</sq><mdash />James Clear<mdash />associates this feeling with the <term>Value of Disappointment</term>. Basically, your progress is <em>not</em> a linear line always going up that you can feel every day. Instead, it's more of an exponential curve that starts slow and gradually picks up the speed. Though there are days when you feel like it's not going anywhere, there are also days when something just clicks, and you're on a roll.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you get stuck, maybe find a new simple goal and learn a new language? You've learned the fundamentals, which are applicable to most modern programming languages. So as you learn the 2nd, the 3rd language, and so on, you're discovering new possibilities, and your potential is only ever going up.
    </p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-pe-open-minded">
    <title>Be Open-Minded</title>
    
    <warning>
      <p>
        You should always be open to new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should keep a balance between building good habits and trying new things.
      </p>
    </warning>
    
    <p>
      There are always gonna be new interesting things to learn. So, keep an open mind and be eager to learn them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In coding communities, there are often conventions and rules of thumb such as:
      <ul>
        <li>
          how to name variables
        </li>
        <li>
          how to format code
        </li>
        <li>
          how to organize files
        </li>
        <li>
          <etc />
        </li>
      </ul>
      People learn them to improve efficiency and cooperation. And depending on the community, purpose, or programming language, standards are gonna vary. Thus, you should be objective and neutral when entering new environments and meeting new people, since you have to learn their game.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a beginner, nobody but you will read your code. So, it's good to create a good balance between learning good habits and having freedom. Basically, you should always try to improve your code, but also take it easy. There's no need to be able to produce beautiful or efficient code right off the bat, cause that'd be super stressful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Experienced programmers often share best practices. These can be extremely beneficial to know about, but also harmful if overused without a good understanding. They are supposed to help you think critically and adapt quickly to new situations, not make you a close-minded coder who always does things the same way.

    <title>Some Technical Pointers</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-pe-virtual-environment">
      <title>Use A Simple Virtual Environment</title>
      
      <warning>
        <p>
          Look for and use a simple virtual environment, which helps prevent conflicts between incompatible programming packages and dependencies.
        </p>
      </warning>
      
      <p>
        Let's say you wanna make a game with Python. So you do just that<mdash />you download and install Python version 3.11.6 and Pygame (the Python library for making games). And everything works just fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast forward... You suddenly have the urge to make some cool animations with Python. So you ask the Internet and Manim shows up. You excitedly follow its installation guide and are eager to get started. At one point, it says something along the lines of <q>Manim needs Python version 3.12.1 to work...</q> Not a problem? All you have to do is update Python and everything's good to go again.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, when you go back to your Pygame projects, which were running just fine before, there are errors. Looking into those, you find out that Pygame doesn't work with Python version 3.12.1 yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        So do you downgrade Python to continue developing games at the expense of Manim, or do you forsake the games you've been so passionate about?
      </p>

      <p>
        A worse case is when you accidentally install both versions of Python and have them run simultaneously. Now this can really mess your PC up as conflicts upon conflicts show up.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, a straightforward solution is to use a virtual environment, which prevents the not-so-hypothetical predicament above. It helps manage programming packages and dependencies on a per-environment basis, meaning you can have multiple environments unrelated to one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, you can set up two separate environments<mdash />one with Python 3.11.6 and Pygame installed, and the other with Python 3.12.1 and Manim. Problem's solved!
      </p>

    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-pe-cli">
      <title>Know A Bit About Command-Line Interfaces</title>
      
      <warning>
        <p>
          As you explore the world of programming on your own, you will naturally learn to use command-line interfaces.
        </p>
      </warning>

      <p>
        When the time comes for you to explore different languages and tools on your own, you will have to use command-line interfaces (CLI) frequently. For the sake of simplicity, CLI are just the <sq>lower-level</sq> counterparts of user interfaces (UI). On Windows, the two built-in CLI are Command Prompt (CMD) and Windows PowerShell.
      </p>

      <p>
        But don't worry, you don't have to take a course on this. You will gradually learn the common commands as you go. Detailed guides always have commands ready to be copy-pasted into your CLI and run with a press of the Enter key anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Honestly, when I use PyPI (or PIP, which is a package manager for Python) all I know is how to install, update, and uninstall stuff. And I use the CMD for navigating files, switching between administration modes, and using virtual environments. That's it, nothing else really.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Finally, if errors show up when using a CLI, you just need to apply exactly what you've learned in the previous section.
      </p>
