  <introduction>
    <p>
      Welcome my friend! This is an article on <term>programming</term> and its most <term>fundamental concepts</term>, as you can see in the Table of Contents to your left. The knowledge is designed to be as beginner-friendly as possible, making each section a 5 to 10-minute read.
    </p>

      This article is also adapted into videos, which are <url href="https://www.youtube.com/" visual="youtube.com">available on Youtube</url> and also embedded into the corresponding section. This way, whether you are a visual or auditory learner, or both, you can find the most comfortable way to enjoy this tutorial. (P.S. The videos are short and quite silly because I'm new to editing.)
    </p>

    <p>
      That's it! Going forward I hope I can give you a good first impression of the wonderful world of programming. Despite the title, I hope this article will be useful and entertaining to both complete novices and those who've had minimal contact with programming.

      An overview of the contents:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <term>Sections 1 and 2</term>: An introduction to the article.
        </li>
        <li>
          <term>Sections 3 to 10</term>: Fundamental concepts of programming.
        </li>
        <li>
          <term>Sections 11 and 12</term>: My personal experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Sections 13 to 19 (under development, tentative)</term>: Slightly more advanced fundamental concepts.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      New concepts will be introduced with the following structure:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Definition
        </li>
        <li>
          Ví dụ code
        </li>
        <li>
          Explanations for examples
        </li>
      </ol>

      When running <em>code examples</em>, you should <term>simultaneously</term> read the corresponding explanations for the best learning experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also watch the videos, before or after reading each section. They have cool visuals and present ideas in a different way.
