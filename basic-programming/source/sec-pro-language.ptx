  <p>
    <term>A programming language</term> is a system of notation that helps human to create computer programs or, in other words, give instructions to computers. These <q>instructions</q> range from calculating additions and subtractions to data manipulations, <etc></etc>
  </p>

  <p>
    The code cell below is written in <term>Python</term><mdash></mdash>one of the most popular programming languages in the recent years. You can run the code and see the results.
  </p>

  <sage language="python">
    <input>
      print("Hello World!")
    </input>
  </sage>
  <problem>
    <pre>
      Hello World!
    </pre>
  </problem>
  
  <investigation>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The command <c>print()</c> have a simple job of putting data into the terminal. In this case, that data is the words <q>Hello World!</q>.
    </p>
  </investigation>

  <p>
    Here is another code block written in Python. (You don't have to understand what the code is doing.)
  </p>

  <program language="python">
    <input>
      a = 0
      while a &lt; 10:
          print(a, end=" ")
          if a % 2 == 0:
              print("is even")
          else:
              print("is odd")
          a += 1
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    You can easily see that there are <term>keywords</term> such as <c>while</c>, <c>print</c> <c>end</c>, <c>if</c>, and <c>else</c>. This means Python's syntax includes keywords and features that closely resemble the English language.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-prolang-high-level">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Python is called a <term>high-level</term> programming language because its syntax closely resembles human languages.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Therefore, Python is usually recommended to beginners, which is also why it is one of the most well-known programming languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following example is written in <term>Assembly</term>. The code when compiled will also output the words <q>Hello World!</q>.
  </p>

  <program language="assy">
    <input>
      org  0x100 
      mov  dx, msg
      mov  ah, 9
      int  0x21

      mov  ah, 0x4c
      int  0x21

      msg  db 'Hello World!', 0x0d, 0x0a, '$'
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    As you can see, this is almost fully computer language. Assembly needs 7 lines of code to do what Python can do with one.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-prolang-low-level">
    <statement>
      <p>
        So, Assembly is called a <term>low-level</term> programming language, since its syntax is closer to computer languages.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    In conclusion, the syntax of high-level languages are most likely easier to understand than that of low-level ones. Maybe you would ask <q>When or why should we use low-level languages then?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    There can be many reasons for that, some of which are speed, potential, or specialization, <etc></etc>
  </p>
  
  <insight>
    <p>
      You can imagine a high-level programming language as a 4-seat family car, which is user-friendly and can be driven by most people. Then, a low-level one would be a F1 racing car that only the most skillful professionals can drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in return, the <q>low-level</q> F1 racing car will be significantly faster than the <q>high-level</q> family car.
    </p>
  </insight>

  <convention>
    <p>
      In this book, coding examples are written in high-level languages<mdash></mdash>mostly <term>Python</term> and <term>SageMath</term>, making it easier for you to follow and experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each programming language has its own set of notations, which is developed in consideration of its purpose. Python is a high-level multi-purpose language.
    </p>
  </convention>

  <p>
    Some additional information:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Python</term> is a high-level multi-purpose programming language. It is used by mathematicians, data scientists, software developers, game developers, <etc></etc>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The book often uses <term>Numpy</term><mdash />an <term>extending library</term> that provides additional mathematical features, including matrices, for Python.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>SageMath</term> is a high-level language built on top of Numpy and other mathematical packages.

    <title>Choosing A Programming Language</title>
    <p>
      When getting started with programming, a beginner often comes across certain topics:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Which programming language should I start with?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Which programming language should I learn in 2024?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Which programming language to learn for high-paying jobs?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <etc></etc>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      I think these are impractical questions, and I would advise you against that mindset. Instead, you should ask questions such as:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is my purpose to learn a new programming language?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For that purpose, which programming language is suitable?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do I want to learn a high-level or low-level language?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <etc></etc>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Currently there are an ever-growing number of programming languages, and each of them has its own <em>purposes, pros, and cons</em>.
